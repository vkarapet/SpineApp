MMAT Development Startup
========================

Prerequisites: Node.js installed, dependencies installed (npm install in both mmat/ and mmat/server/).

Starting Up
-----------

1. Start the proxy stub (in one terminal):

   cd mmat/server
   npm start

   You should see: "MMAT Proxy Stub running on http://localhost:3001"

2. Start the dev server (in a second terminal):

   cd mmat
   npm run dev

   You should see:
     Local:   http://localhost:5173/
     Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173/

3. Open the app:
   - On your laptop: http://localhost:5173
   - On your phone (same WiFi): use the Network URL printed above

Shutting Down
-------------

Press Ctrl+C in each terminal window to stop the respective server.

Notes
-----

- The proxy stub uses an in-memory store. All data is lost when it stops.
- The Vite dev server proxies /api/* requests to the proxy stub automatically.
- Phone access requires both devices on the same WiFi network.
